## General idea
This Python project uses the Descend Gradient method in order to solve classification and regression problems.

## Goal
* Data normalisation and testing: Transforming the data into a normalized form and validating it, as well as testing it afterwards.
* Creating the self-learning system: Projecting the systems and evaluating their performances with different metrics.
